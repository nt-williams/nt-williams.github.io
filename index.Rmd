I'm a biostatistician and research software engineer who focuses on the development (and application) of nonparametric methods with the goal of answering causal questions. My most recent substantive work has been in the area of substance abuse epidemiology. I currently work in the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University with [Kara Rudolph](https://kararudolph.github.io/), and frequently collaborate with [Iván Díaz](https://idiaz.xyz/) at NYU.

I'm beginning a Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley in Fall 2025. I received a B.A. in Psychology from the University of Colorado, Boulder in 2017 and an M.P.H in Biostatistics from Columbia University in 2019.
